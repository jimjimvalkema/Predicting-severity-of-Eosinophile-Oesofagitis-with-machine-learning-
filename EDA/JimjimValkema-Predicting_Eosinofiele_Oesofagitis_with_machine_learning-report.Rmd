## data set  
TODO codebook

## introduction  
TODO: explain EOS, signifacance contribution to research, use case algo/cli, how data collected

## materials and methods

### software  
TODO versions and double check missing libraries
The exploratory data analysis has been done using rmarkdown with the following packages: 
* ggplot: for creating plots    
* gridExtra: further styling plots  
* reshape2: transform data from wide and long formats  
* rlist: appending items in a list  
* ggcorrplot: creating a correlation plot  
* cluster: creating pca clusters   
  
  
Creating the machine learning model has been done in weka.  
  
Development of the wekawrapper has been done in intellij with the java programming language.  
  
### exploratory data analysis   
TODO explain why scale norm,log, remove missing, distrubution, correlation

### evaluation metrics    
TODO why false negatives bad   

### speed and scalability
TODO why accuracy most important
   
### Exploring algorithms  
TODO why no zeroR oneR and ibk (because no model = overfit)
TODO algos used

### meta algorithms  
TODO: why different settings?

### Attribute selection  
Why different methods. Why high acc on low attr but still bad idea because overfit

## results    
TODO alot of cleanup missing data, normalisation etc    
 
TODO resulting model accuracy speed 
  
TODO why scaling norm

TODO cli
 
## discussion   
TODO what if enough data? what if new insight with this analysis of ml algo? EOS might be complex issue? param selection? No wieght on false negatives?


## Conclusion
TODO not enough data, inaccurated, good work flow future projects (cli, analysis, etc)
## project proposal  
TODO further improvemnt: better data, explorer more attributes, nearal net
TODO better cli / ui + why user + platforms
